### Hello world 👋, I'm Iwona! 

I graduated from **Le Wagon full stack coding bootcamp** in Berlin and I'm ready to conquer the tech world! The first step of this masterplan is becoming a junior **front end developer**! 🖌️🎨 

🔶 **What's the story?**

I'm a corporate communication trainer with a passion for coding! What started off as simple curiosity and a need to keep up with the digital world, brought me all the way to **designing, implementing and shipping to production web and mobile apps!** 📈

What I love the most about the whole process is giving your idea the shape and **implementing the design**, this is where everything comes to life, including me! 🌱

🔶 **Skills**: HTML / CSS / Bootstrap / JavaScript ES6 / SQL / git / GitHub / Heroku / Ruby on Rails / Figma

🔶 **Currently learning:** more JavaScript and React!
